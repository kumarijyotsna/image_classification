#This is CNN model trained on cifar-10 dataset
#keras is used for this
Use Keras if you need a deep learning libraty that:
* Allows for easy and fast prototyping
* Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two
* Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU

#cifar_cnn.py is for training on dataset and saving the model
#test.py is for testing the saved model on the images
#model.h5 is saved model
